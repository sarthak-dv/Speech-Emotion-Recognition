# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This project presents a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system designed using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Our model surpasses an SVM baseline by 15%, achieving an accuracy of 77% on the RAVDESS dataset. The system leverages audio processing libraries such as soundfile and librosa to extract crucial audio features, including MFCCs, chroma, and mel spectrogram features, to classify emotions effectively.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarthak-dv/speech-emotion-recognition.git
cd Speech-Emotion-Recognition
jupyter notebook speech.ipynb
